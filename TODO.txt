IMPORTANT: jogging: we really need to do this?  ( https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki/Grbl-v1.1-Jogging )
            the actual widget works quite good for jogging, I don't see so much enhancements 
            adding those commands.
            
            I think it's would be much better 
            to create a new widget to control the machine from an analog joystick
            maybe connected with an arduino to the spjs (or better way wireless!)
            and use the $J commands to do that.

            JUSTIN:
            there are good reasons to implement the $J interface.  the main one is the jog reporting and the lack of modality. 
            but it's not vital! 
            Question: should we prevent X/Y jogging when Z<=0?  or perhaps alert the user that they could be destroying their bit or their workpiece?





- Jogging command must be like:
    cmd = '$J=G91' + direction + val + " F" + feedrate + "\n";
    otherwise the command its executed in absolute machine coords

- We need an input/btn to choose Feedrate for the $J commands
